# Path Models

## ANC112_pathModel.mat

Path models of a single-channel ANC system measured in our lab.

It contains two variables, corresponding to the primary path and the secondary path.

For Model_Primary, the two dimensions represent time series and physical/virtual route selection, respectively.

For Model_Secondary, the two dimensions represent time series and physical/virtual route selection, respectively.

## ANC224_pathModel.mat

Path models measured in our lab for (2,2,4) ANC simulation.

It contains two variables, corresponding to the primary path and the secondary path.

For Model_Primary, the four dimensions represent the primary source number, time series, error microphone number and physical/virtual route selection, respectively.

For Model_Secondary, the four dimensions represent secondary source number, time series, error microphone number and physical/virtual path selection, respectively.
